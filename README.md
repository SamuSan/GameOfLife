GameOfLife
==========

Ruby implementation of Conway's Game of Life, purely for my own learning. Trying to get to grips with Ruby.
Future Work : 
*Implement a GUI 
*Refactor the snot out of this, God class does way to much, pretty sure World could be pulled out into its own class,
*Remove extraneous functions from Grub class
